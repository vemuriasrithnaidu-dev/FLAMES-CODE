Project Overview

The FLAMES Game Program is a fun, console-based application developed in C language that predicts the relationship between two people based on their names.

The program removes common characters from both names, counts the remaining letters, and uses the classic FLAMES algorithm to determine the relationship.

This project is mainly created for learning string manipulation concepts in C and is often used as a beginner-friendly mini project.
